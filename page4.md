    A README.md file is a guide that gives visitors a detailed description of your project. There is a lot of developers that developed awesome application but if you represent your project well than your project will have great impact, it will gain more.
    If someone visits your project repo then this is the file that will represent your project. So you should put some effort to make your README.md look good.
    You don't need to make always a new README.md. Just create a template and use that for all the projects.

When you write a README.md file always keep in mind that this is for others not for you.

    Now have a look at my project and share your thoughts with me, what you think about the repo it is looking good or not? Can you use this project without any help just by reading README.md?

You can also create simple and stunning README.md in very simple steps.
So, let's start creating your README.md

One more thing you need to know there is no right or wrong way of Creating README.md, Every Developer has their way of writing the README.md file. I'll explain to you each and everything you can do to create your own.

Github uses its markdown known as GFM (Github Flavour markdown). It just extends the functionality of markdown. So, you can use simple HTML tags and their attributes to make it look good. You can use Emojis, links, pictures,
Project title

At the very top, you must include a project title using heading 1, Now heading 1 in markdown is with one # sign but you can also use the h1 tag. For example:
# Project title

    or I also like to make it center so,

<h1 align="center">Project title</h1>

we are using, align="center" because we can't use CSS here.
Description

After the title, you must provide a description of the project and it should not be a long paragraph just a simple descriptive line will do the job. This is the line that should be well crafted and straightforward.
It describes the quality of your project because no one will run the project at the moment they visit but they judge the project its description.

# Project Description

    or if also like to make it at the center so,

<p align="center">Project Description</p>
Table of Content

Github added this feature already so you don't need to do it. So, Just use headings (#), subheadings(#), or h1,h2 tags and it will automatically have at the top left corner of your README.md file.
Links

Use markdown link as [Link Text](link) of your live project, repo, API, API repo. I am sure you are wondering why you should put repo here but your project is not always be seen on GitHub people also clone it on their system and this file also gets cloned so you must put this link there. So, anyone can visit back the repo.
Include screenshots

You can use Images to show your project, how it looks while running. For putting screenshots you can either drag and drop images or use the image in markdown as ![Image Name](Image location)
How to use your software

The most important part after the description is this, You need to provide instruction on how to install your program and how to run it. Make it comprehensive as much as possible So, even a beginner can use it.
